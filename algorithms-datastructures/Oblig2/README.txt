1. Compile using *Java, Oblig2.java 'inputfile.txt'
2. Main-method in Oblig2.java
3. I have assumed that you do not need to store the information about the time schedule, only print it, though
this could be changed relatively easy.
4. I do not know exactly, but I think some of my implementations are redundant. I can not put my finger
on it, but I think some of the implementations could be more efficient.
5. Everything works, except the slack calculation for buildgarage.txt and buildrail.txt. This may be
because of the increased complexity of the graph, or something i have overseen in my coding. But I can not
seem to figure out what is wrong. Would like feedback on this if you can tell what is wrong.
