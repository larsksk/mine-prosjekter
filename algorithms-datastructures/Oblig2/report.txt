1.
The file readers complexity is O(n), where n is the number of tasks in the project.

Time complexity for no cycles:
The DFS's time complexity, since these are directed graphs with adjacency lists, are O(V)+O(E)=O(V+E).
Where V are the number of nodes, and E are edges.

With cycle:
O(1)

The printer's time complexity is O(n) + O(1)*x = O(n+x), where n is the minimal time minimal time for the project to
complete, and x is the number of changes. A change occurs when there is a task stopping or starting for a given
time interval.

2.
The requirements for the input graph for the project to be successfully planned is
that it must not contain any cycles, it has to be directed, and contain only one component.

Used DFS f.eks to find cycles, connectivity, shortest path.
